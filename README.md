### Process

All development will happen on the [development](https://github.com/Van-Dame/Cilantro/tree/development) via feature branches. Those feature branches will be merged back into the development branch via pull requests.

Once a number of features have been completed, or an area of the application is feature complete, the development branch will be merged into the [master](https://github.com/Van-Dame/Cilantro/tree/master) branch via a pull request.

A worked example would be:

- A contributor wishes to implement stripe API
- The contributor forks the repo
- The contributor switches to development branch and pulls latest code
- The contributor creates a branch called `feature-stripe-api`
- The contributor makes their changes in this new branch
- The contributor commits their changes
- The contributor submits a pull request for their feature branch

This process is also known as `git flow`, a description of git flow can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
